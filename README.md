# inf-click
A rudimentary inflation fetish idle clicker ~~generated~~ *started* by a couple LLMs.

To play:
- Click the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP"
- Save anywhere you'd like
- Unzip to its own folder, so that it looks like "wherever-you-put-it/inf-click/index.html" etc.
- Open "index.html" in a web browser

Have fun(?)

Planned:
- Some type of progression system (streamer mechanic, new pumps)
- Better UI
- *Maybe* non-belly expansion??? idk. would be hard but fun
- visualization? hard "maybe"
